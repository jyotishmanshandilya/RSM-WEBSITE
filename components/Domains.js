                <p className='text-center text-base'>AI is an interdisciplinary science with multiple approaches. <br/> 
                Research in machine learning and deep learning has brought about a paradigm 
                shift in virtually every aspect of life. <br/> At RSM, we dive into several 
                sub-fields such as NLP, CV, Reinforcement Learning, GANs, Federated Learning 
                and so much more.
